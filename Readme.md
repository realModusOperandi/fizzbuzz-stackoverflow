# FizzBuzz

This repository solves the FizzBuzz interview question, which asks for a function which prints numbers in order, replacing those divisible by 3 and 5 with "fizzbuzz", those divisible only by 3 with "fizz" and those divisible only by 5 with "buzz."

It does this in the way a programmer normally works, by Googling for the solution and blindly running the first result that compiles properly.
